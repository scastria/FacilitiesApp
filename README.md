# Description
Facilities provides employees with easy navigation of their company’s office space(s), saving everyone time and energy in the workplace. Employees can search and navigate to specific conference rooms, co-workers, break rooms, printers, and more. Facilities provides information about these locations as well, such as size of conference room and accommodations, printer numbers and many other categories that can be configured on the map of each floor. IT can easily search and navigate to specific employees’ desks/offices when needed, saving a ton of time. Visitors from other offices who are unfamiliar with the space can easily navigate the office as well. Time is money and with Facilities, your employees will spend less time searching for each other, conference rooms, printers, and more, leaving more time available for their main responsibilities.
